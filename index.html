      <p class="box1"> HI! My name is Zosia and I'm a senior in high school at HSPVA.
        I'll be applying to college soon so that is on my mind right now. Also
        I am a pianist so I am working on preparing my senior recital for next year. What
        is a senior recital you may ask. Well it is an opportunity for all seniors
        at my high school to showcase all that they've learned about their art over the
        past four years. Mine just happens to be about half an hour of just me playing
        piano for all of my friends and family. Kindof scary. Also I am doing the
        Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program. That is where I learned how to make
        this exact website. Pretty cool right. Well anyway. This is where I found the
        inspiration for my Girl Scout Gold Award. Thanks for reading my dissertation.
